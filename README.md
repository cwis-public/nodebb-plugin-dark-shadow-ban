Shadow bans some users

Before you use this plugin, you must copy the file config.json.sample to config.json, and edit this file to put the UIDs of the user that you want to hide from view of the other posters.

Note that administrators and global moderators still have view access to these posts, and nothing prevent them from quoting them, which might lead to disclosure to other users.
